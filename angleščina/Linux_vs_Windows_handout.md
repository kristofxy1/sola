## Handout for presentation "Linux vs Windows"

In the presentation I will introduce myself and tell why I think that linux is better than linux. I will go through my main arguments that are:
    1. you can customize it in many different ways
    2. you can use different distributions
    3. it is free
### 1. argument customization
Customization in windows is just wallpaper and changing theme.
In linux you can customize all things that you have on desktop.
In the linux really the sky is the limit of customization.
We have different setups in distributions..

### 2. Different distributions
Distributions are different setups of themes and other settings.
You have many of it avaliable on the internet.
You can use just the right distribution for your needs and wishes.
### 3. it is free
For windows we have to pay.
Linux is totaly free.
Linux is opensource. 
Linux have better security and don't spy for your datas.

### Concluzion:  
    You can be productive s never before.
    If you are a lot of time on computers that helps a lot.
    You can use terminal.
    Your computer work for you.
    I prefer linux over windows.
