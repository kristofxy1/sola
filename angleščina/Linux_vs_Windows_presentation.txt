I am Krištof Bučar and I am going to tell you why I think that linux is better than windows.
Here on the presentation we can see Windows logo and I think that all of you use it like every day.
On the other side of the presentation we can se the Linux logo and here I ask you who know what is linux? Please hands up.
For all others linux is "just" another operating system like Macos and Windows.
But today I am going to tell you why to use it instead of Windows that we all know very well.
So my main arguments why to use it are:
    1. you can customize it in many ways
    2. you can use many different distributions
    3.
