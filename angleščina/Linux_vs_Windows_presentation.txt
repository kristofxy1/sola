I am Krištof Bučar and I am going to tell you why I think that linux is better than windows.
Here on the presentation we can see Windows logo and I think that all of you use it like every day.
On the other side of the presentation we can se the Linux logo and here I ask you who know what is linux? Please hands up.
For all others linux is "just" another operating system like Macos and Windows.
But today I am going to tell you why to use it instead of Windows that we all know very well.
So my main arguments why to use it are:
    1. you can customize it in many ways
    2. you can use many different distributions
    3. free
    4. you can be productive as never before
1. Customization
Lets first see at default Windows light theme.
Here we see basic bar and normal windows blue colour.
In windows we can change to like dark theme and change wallpaper but we can't do anything else.
In the other hand we have Linux. Default we will have prefered distribution theme.
But we don't change it only with changing distribution.
You can change it all. You can change to whatever other theme that will change all apps to theme that you choose.
You can use different bars and different app searcher and many more.
Here we see different setups of linux and here the sky is the limit.

2. Different distributions 
Before I mention something about distributions. 
Distributions are basicaly different setups of themes and other settings and you can really choose the right one depending on your needs and wishes.
In windows you can buy only one big operating system with many apps that you don't need and are just using your computer space.
But in linux you can pick just the right one that have just what you need and nothing more.
That means that you have lightweight operating system that you can use even on old computers.
Many tells information that Windows operating system requies 32 Gb and normal linux system requires 7 Gb.

3. Linux is complitely free
I don't have money to buy 100€ Windows.
I will rather use totaly free linux that is in my opinion better.

4. you can be productive as never before
Lets see about the Quarantene - we were on the computers all day and what if we use something that fastes your productivity.
You will make all things faster and in easier way.
There helps linux a lot.
You can use your terminal to do things fast and like you want.
With linux you can make your computer works for you.

I hope that you enjoyed and understand why I prefer linux over windows.
