Today I am going to present you why you should prefer linux over Windows.
Here we can see my main arguments why:
    - customization
    - many different options
    - productivity
    - free
    - not purchase your data
    - and a lot more

# first customization
We can se this bored every day used Windows wallpaper. 
Just blue, same theme every time. 
Can I change it? No.
I can just set it to other colour or change wallpaper - boring. 
In linux you can use whatever you like - you can even at easy way program your own theme or just use what one did before.
Here the sky is the limit. 
you can change all things and have multiple bars different bars and lots of more. 
Just look at all of these different setups. 
And because of that linux is better.

# second different distributions
In linux you have many diferent distriubtions. 
What that is? This is basicaly configuration for one purpose - to be what it is for.
That means that unlike on windows you use just what you need.
Why have something that you don't need if this just uses your disk-space and your cpu cores, on the other side you don't have what is important to you.
Because of these you should pick one distribution that is configured just for you and for your use of computers.
From gaming, programing, just basic internet using - for all of these you have one distribution that makes it easy.

#third you can be productive as never before
Lets see about the Quarantene - we were on the computers like all day and what if we use something that fastes your productivity.
You will make all things faster and in easier way.
There helps linux a lot.
You can use your terminal to do things fast and like you want.
With linux you can make your computer works for you.

# on the other hand linux is complitely free
I don't have mony for crap 100â‚¬ Windows if i have better and totaly free Linux.
What makes it free? - it is open source.
That means that it source code is avaliable for public view and configuration. 
And if you have a lot of diferent programers that can change it - all world bugs and other things will be find faster than on other payed companies.
It is written by peoples for peoples and just for you. 

I hope that you enjoyed and understand why I prefer linux over windows.
